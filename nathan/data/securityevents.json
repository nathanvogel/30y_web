After a prolonged sting investigation, Secret Service agents swoop down on organizers and prominent members of BBSs in 14 U.S. cities including the Legion of Doom, conducting early-morning raids and arrests. The arrests involve and are aimed at cracking down on credit-card theft and telephone and wire fraud. The result is a breakdown in the hacking community, with members informing on each other in exchange for immunity. The offices of Steve Jackson Games are also raided, and the role-playing sourcebook GURPS Cyberpunk is confiscated, possibly because the government fears it is a \"handbook for computer crime\". Legal battles arise that prompt the formation of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, including the trial of Knight Lightning."

It would also hit a web page counter when it took control, allowing the programmer who created it as well as the world to track the progress of the worm.
